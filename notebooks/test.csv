1184,1463261392887156737,918426768,"Elizabeth claims she could not reveal the identity of strategic investors (one of which is Dignity Health), even to early investor Chris Lucas, owing to confidentiality agreements. I think this is pretty weird - one customarily interprets such a clause as outwards-facing"
1185,1463256679697375232,918426768,"Elizabeth claims that executive turnover at Walgreens was responsible for the failure of the partnership, and not the high proportion of Venus draws nor the low number of stores that had rolled out Theranos machines"
1186,1463253948194721796,918426768,"Defense: How long were board meetings at Theranos?. Elizabeth: Full days, sometimes with dinner the night before. Holy SHIT that sucks"
1187,1463253145610448896,918426768,"You could summarize todays testimony as Theranos had real technology that was developed properly by trained adults, with the implication that whatever bad stuff happened was an incidental, unfortunate outcome."
1188,1463252300193955840,918426768,Elizabeth again reiterating that their competitors could put us out of business with the trade secret of testing blood with a smaller sample and claims she put the question of whether they ought to patent vs trade secret to her board.
1189,1463251442492342274,918426768,Okay Im really passing out now coffee number two is not doing it
1190,1463247563562254346,918426768,Defense shows extremely grainy flowchart that purports to show that Theranos informed the FDA of its use of conventional analyzers.
1191,1463244986279870467,918426768,"Defense showing an email from Elizabeth to the FDA regarding the presubmission of their device in 2013, implying that the company always had the intention of the cooperating with the FDA. Notably, these are just presubmission filings and not a submission itself"
1192,1463240933948805124,918426768,"Elizabeth now claiming to have never imposed any deadline on product launch, in a bid to seem to have been sensitive to weaknesses in assay quality. This seems wild to me as a matter of he-said she-said: multiple witnesses for the prosecution have said flatly otherwise."
1193,1463239435210743810,918426768,"Defense hammering (a) Elizabeth did not pressure any employee into validating assays (b) Elizabeth herself unqualified to judge an assay. Highlighting that others are to blame seems reasonable but it still seems hard to overcome all the direct evidence of fraud by her, personally"
1194,1463236210063601669,918426768,"When asked why she disclosed the use of other machines to FDA inquiry but not other commercial partners, she claims that this owed to FDAs guarantee of trade secret protection. Again, this seems crazy - its not hard to get NDA on a big commercial contract"
1195,1463235750074277889,918426768,"Elizabeth defends the secret tecan machine modifications as private patent applications and a legitimate scientific development, echoing rhetoric used during previous SEC depositions."
1196,1463217738906628102,918426768,"Its really trippy to me that watching Elizabeth testify is like watching a long, boring, and anodyne presentation about like, immunoassays and emails, but in reality she is up there on the stand fighting for her life. You wouldnt know it - shes smiling while answering."
1197,1463216940810268677,918426768,"Elizabeth now claiming (and this is a surprise to me) that she had hundreds of employees working on an internal factory to produce her devices. Given rationale was expertise building and cost savings, both of which seem psycho to me. Better control of the fraud, more like."
1198,1463215219769950210,918426768,"Im sitting next to , producer on the excellent podcast The Dropout who raises this absolutely wild point about what the jury isnt allowed to know"
1199,1463212748909670400,918426768,"I get the feeling that the defense is going to spend the entire day on a technical defense of the soundness of Elizabeths decisionmaking. I think doing the sunny sexual abuse angle would actually undermine this, so Im trending towards not thinking theyll play this card"
1200,1463211230240272389,918426768,"Asked to explain theranos breakthrough sample miniaturization patent, Elizabeth simply explains that their improved method changed reagent ratios and mixing times. I find this very funny but no one is laughing in the courtroom"
1201,1463208126199394306,918426768,I really love it when the defense pretends to ask some question like am I right in understanding your machines would draw blood in stores? and Liz says yes! like the lawyers made some breakthrough and not like theyve drilled this routine a dozen times
1202,1463206075809685508,918426768,Elizabeth is good at saying yes or I did emphatically while nodding her head I am slowly falling in love with her
1203,1463205840807084032,918426768,Defense produces a report purporting to show that Johns Hopkins lab team evaluated Theranos tech very favorably. Theyre doing pretty good up there tbh
1204,1463204016880422914,918426768,"Defense notes that Pfizer employees were ccd on the report with the allegedly doctored logo, which is a fair enough point I suppose"
1205,1463203055797616647,918426768,I should clarify she admits to personally adding the logos before emailing the reports.
1206,1463202907864518660,918426768,"Elizabeth admits adding the Pfizer etc logos to the doctored reports to Walgreens and Safeway, claims that she was under the impression that pharma companies had signed off on and validated Theranos tests. Fucking unreal! Love it."
1207,1463202164440924161,918426768,I just think its kinda wild that Elizabeth and Downey are the only ones in here not wearing a mask
1208,1463201291077705733,918426768,"Theranos board slide claiming that glaxosmithkline endorsed Theranos tech as a lab replacement, unclear how true the quote is"
1209,1463196949692108801,918426768,our technology worked by having the cartridge call the cloud
1210,1463195848863453184,918426768,"Defense is really stressing that Holmes lab report, Ian Gibbons, had communicated to her that their assays were working or had the potential to work. Side note I am falling asleep I have been up since yesterday lmao"
1211,1463188777480773639,918426768,"Reporters are just sitting around tweeting, this is peak trial reporting. I am among my tribe at last"
1212,1463186737891459074,918426768,"This was me. I am now in the same room as my idol, Elizabeth Holmes . God is great"
1213,1463151164078243840,918426768,Danielles selling some stuff reporters are losing their minds
1214,1463129340133068803,918426768,Were 26-28th in line. Everyone here is a reporter.
1215,1463087803055546369,918426768,Dragging myself out of bed to drive to San Jose to watch Elizabeth Holmes attempt to save her life through persuasion should be a fun day
1216,1463008724742668289,918426768,Holy shit the dude smoking is my bartender randomly (this is him looking at the photo I emailed to him)
1217,1463005137773813761,918426768,"This is an absolutely insane story. Like, a billionaire watched Westworld and then was like, yeah, I could do that"
1218,1462962338416390146,918426768,just wandering around the mission with a 50mm f/1.8

1226,1461865693721157632,918426768,really unusual sunset tonight!
1227,1461821852305682436,918426768,"Terra Ignota is s Book of the New Sun, and a generational achievement for science fiction. No, I will not be taking further questions."
1228,1461779290543038465,918426768,"I am begging the dsa to consider that this may not be the case, and to consider moderating their stance as a hedge. Were willing to meet you where you are on a lot of tenants rights issues, join us (or at least hedge) on the supply one. I mean this completely earnestly."
1229,1461777516784353281,918426768,"Instead you watch two men who have never fought with knives before go at it like a couple of borges guachos. dont understand the vips wanting it watch this, way more interesting to just watch  UFC or something"

1235,1461197054277865479,918426768,This is the California blackpill
1236,1460698602477535234,918426768,Just want to note that I correctly predicted the ISA rollbacks
1237,1460690521437863936,918426768,"I guess this marks the end of the Lambda School ISA. We had a good ride, everyone. Thanks for following along with my incredible journey."
1238,1460688398830632960,918426768,Lambda School dm 500 strangers to receive a lifesaving tuition refund challenge. One thing thats obviously fucked up about this is by about week 35 of job searching you probably need to take ANY job to survive and are therefore less likely to be able to continue dming fuckers.
1239,1460677883219701763,918426768,"It seems like my piece is well timed, as I incidentally go over why one needs to be very careful with money back tuition guarantees as well. Contracts vary, but students can be put on job seeking programs with very difficult milestones that weed out struggling students."
1240,1460670316946997251,918426768,"As a bonus, after reading this piece you should have a very firm grasp of the mathematics behind why Paul is being a little naive baby here"
1241,1460669802423328777,918426768,The piece also has some excellent advice by  about how to interrogate school admins about whether the school is a good fit.  I especially love his suggestion to ask after how many code reviews you will regularly receive.
1242,1460669801685159937,918426768,"I reached out to GA, Coding Dojo, and Flatiron School to ask point blank why they thought their students had such high rates of non-job-seeking. None were willing to venture a guess as to why so many of their own students seemed uninterested in working with them to get a job."
1243,1460669800368148482,918426768,"Ive been accused many times of being a strangely dedicated Lambda School hater, so today we turn our attention to the more general problem of how students ought to choose bootcamps. Read more to find out how General Assembly achieves 99.2% placement."
1244,1460477642604363777,918426768,"Of 1485 graduates, only 678 found jobs within six months. Lambda instead wants you to focus on the % students who found jobs within about 1.5 years. Even allowing for that, you can see clearly that a huge chunk of graduates are making less even than the ISA repayment threshold."
1245,1460477639693520896,918426768,Im back and a quick glance at the new outcomes report tells the whole story. One can understand why the report is all but hidden on their site. Lambda pulls out all the classic statistical tricks (more on this in an upcoming piece) to vastly overstate its numbers.
1246,1460446685067296769,918426768,"I have been informed I completely missed their 2020 outcomes report, which I guess they just sort of put out there without telling anyone about. I have to go to dinner, but stand by for more analysis later:"
1247,1460440833761574917,918426768,"Austen, if you really did name your school after Benjamin Bloom, this pablum is a travesty."
1248,1460438762790408198,918426768,For more reading on Bloom (I really do recommend the paper) chase the link trail:
1249,1460438678262607874,918426768,An astute reader points out that the name is likely a reference to the famous Blooms 2-sigma problem: why does every other form of education do worse than 1:1 tutoring by 2  std. deviations? I find it really funny that Austen knows about Bloom but runs a video lecture factory.
1250,1460431776866652165,918426768,"If Lambda School is being forced to change its name, its safe to say Lambda Labs found some pretty damning evidence during discovery..."
1251,1460431775864262656,918426768,BREAKING: a source informs me that the name change owes primarily to the trademark dispute they had with Lambda Labs (). The suit was settled very secretively in July - looks like were just now seeing some of the fallout of that.
1252,1460422554506588165,918426768,"Rebranding will be just the latest in a series of dramatic changes to school structure the administration has attempted. Time will tell whether this one ends up being another short change con that cuts students loose, or an actual reinvention."

If you think Kaggle is just throwing compute at the competition, I invite you to get torched in an upcoming competition 😂"
1536,1539579027807096832,1186043355710545920,"A final note:. Im confident someone will read this and think look how stupid that solution is, you had to ensemble all of those models! Thats totally impractical!. Yeah, it is. I only did it because I ran out of time to do feature engineering."
1537,1539579025303121920,1186043355710545920,"The linear optimizer is my go-to since I find it to be the most reliable, and it worked the best for me here.. Stacking and boosting gave me worse (or equivalent) results."

1539,1539579020198588417,1186043355710545920,I trained a variety of models. Heres a list of the ones that made the cut:. • deberta-v3-large. • deberta-v3-base. • deberta-v2-xxlarge. • bert-for-patents. • funnel-transformer/(large/xlarge)-base. • albert-xxlarge-v2. • electra-base

1544,1539579006869045248,1186043355710545920,Things I tried that didnt work:. • FAISS for finding additional CPC information. • MLM pretraining on CPC descriptions. • Adding patent vocabulary to my tokenizers. • Ordinal regression head (copied from ). • Using Pearson correlation as a loss function. and much more.
1545,1539579004293828608,1186043355710545920,"The real trick (that I missed) was that there was high correlation between the different targets for each anchor.. So, some of the high-ranked finishers added the other targets for each anchor to the end of their prompt, which helped a lot."
1546,1539579001676566528,1186043355710545920,"This was good, but I wanted some more variety.. So, I trained a couple more models using the prompt:. similarity of {anchor} to {target} in relation to {CPC description}. This lead to a reliable boost in my cross-validation when I ensembled."
1547,1539578999097044992,1186043355710545920,I (along with most others) found the best way to do this was to structure your prompt as:. {anchor} + [SEP] + {target} + [SEP] + {CPC description}
1548,1539578996479823873,1186043355710545920,"The goal in this competition was to properly represent the context of the patent to the model.. We were provided with CPC codes, which are basically brief text descriptions of the subject matter of the patent."

1550,1539578991228571648,1186043355710545920,"Insight 2:. This isnt entirely necessary, but for perfections sake its usually smart to ensure each validation set has a comparable target distribution.. This just means that were less at risk of having folds that are significantly easier/harder than others."
1551,1539578988602896384,1186043355710545920,"There were some anchors that were also used as targets. Its probably smart to hold those out, too.. This strategy is quite straightforward to implement using sklearns GroupKFold."
1552,1539578986006622208,1186043355710545920,Insight 1:. This means we need to ensure that the anchors included in our validation set are *not* in the training set.. Doing so means our validation score is a strong indicator of how our model generalizes to anchors its never seen before.
1553,1539578983506882561,1186043355710545920,The key insights here are:. 1. Anchors in production != anchors in training. 2. Different anchors have different score distributions
1554,1539578980608516096,1186043355710545920,"Heres a sample of the phrases you were asked to compare (anchors and targets):. Anchors were repeated several times with a variety of targets, and similarities were on a scale from 0 to 1.. The evaluation metric was the Pearson correlation between your predictions and the score."

The major difference is that you trade off compression efficiency for data loading speed.. My rule of thumb:. • Use parquet when file size is the priority. • Use feather when reading speed is the priority

1613,1531244076808294401,1186043355710545920,"The second reason: your reach. Build an unimpressive resume without building anything, and you get as many eyeballs as resumes you send in.. Build something exciting and share it with the world, and you may get millions of impressions per month.. Which do you think is better?"
1614,1531244074165886976,1186043355710545920,"If you cant write about complex ML topics in a jargon-free manner, you dont understand them.. On top of that, ML topics are highly interconnected. Writing about a project youve already completed gives you incredible a-ha! moments youd overlooked and reveals deeper meaning."
1615,1531244071083094016,1186043355710545920,You arent writing about it. There are two reasons writing as you learn is important.. First: its the only way to truly understand what youre learning.. This image from  is the perfect illustration.
1616,1531244062086336512,1186043355710545920,"The best part?. You can start with the building, and learn the theory that you need to do the building as you go.. No need to spend 3 years learning the theory before you build anything. Thats nonsense."
1617,1531244059397746688,1186043355710545920,"Courses and books are incredibly useful as reference material along your journey.. But, they are not your whole journey!. Building projects and useful outcomes (even at small scale) is the only way to truly learn how those interactions work and build deep knowledge of the craft."

To fully appreciate how that math-y parts fit together and interact with the engineer-y parts, you MUST build projects."
1619,1531244054209392640,1186043355710545920,"Youre over-reliant on courses and books. Data science is an inherently applied field.. Its built on the foundations of statistics, and you most certainly need to learn that.. When data science is applied to a problem, though, *maybe* 5% of it is reliant on that knowledge."
1620,1531244051365695488,1186043355710545920,"This graph is an incredible illustration of this.. This is made for software engineers by , but it holds equally true for data scientists.. Only the folks with unique, specialized skillsets are appealing to companies in 3rd bucket. Theyve differentiated themselves."
1621,1531244043685900288,1186043355710545920,"Not only this, but not everything in the field appeals to everyone... so dont force it.. Data scientists who find their passion and get really good at it are 3-5x more valuable that those who try (and fail) to generalize and be an expert at everything."
1622,1531244041039335427,1186043355710545920,"You arent specializing. Data scientists need to have a wide variety of skills to be successful.. But, the Unicorn doesnt exist. If you want to become an expert, you cant do it by generalizing.. Valuable data scientists are capable of many skills, but are experts in a few."

1643,1527257803546427392,1186043355710545920,"Creating is the key to learning. One of the most important stages of learning is teaching.. For me, writing on Twitter has partially served that purpose.. Teaching and creating are two of the easiest ways to find gaps in your knowledge, and its crazy how much it helps."
1644,1527257800690216960,1186043355710545920,"Technical creators are in short supply. There are a million creators in marketing, sales, fitness, etc.. We techies are vastly underrepresented, though..

1649,1526895416918220800,1186043355710545920,Pipelines &gt; models. Most of the code that goes into training ML models is written either for getting the data to the model or getting the predictions out.. Want fast and reliable models? Spend more time improving your pipelines.
1650,1526895414107963393,1186043355710545920,"Refactor, refactor, refactor. ML code can get out of hand really quickly.. With rapid iteration comes a rapid mess.. Dont be afraid to spend 30 minutes cleaning up your code instead of training models."
1651,1526895411281002496,1186043355710545920,"Create your own framework. 99% of my projects follow the exact same structure.. Down to the names of the files, what goes in them, and when they are created.. Its probably not the most efficient setup, but having such a deep knowledge of the structure makes me work much faster."
1652,1526895408412172289,1186043355710545920,"Reuse old Kaggle solutions. Kaggle solutions are like a database for battle-tested solutions.. If you have a similar enough problem to an old competition, those solution writeups are an absolute goldmine.. My first stop on any problem for literature review is Kaggle."
1653,1526895405601935366,1186043355710545920,"Pick 1 model and max it out. Your first goal should be to take one of those 3-5 models and improve it until you cant anymore.. On image tasks, I usually start by improving efficientnet-b0 until I cant anymore.. On tabular tasks, its usually LightGBM or a random forest."
1654,1526895402783363077,1186043355710545920,"Skip to the good models. For any given problem, there are 3-5 model architectures you should focus (unless you have a really good reason).. The less time youre playing with models, the more time youre spending on high-leverage tasks (feature engineering, data exploration)."
1655,1526895400036184069,1186043355710545920,"Use a GPU wherever you can.  is an absolute blessing.. For 95% of my tabular problems, I can change 2 lines of code to make the whole thing run on my GPU. . Everything from feature engineering to model training.. Ive seen instances where this speeds pipelines up by 50x."
1656,1526895397301432320,1186043355710545920,"Model evaluation is the best time saver. Experiments done with a bad evaluation strategy are a waste of time.. Conversely, a good evaluation setup is the most powerful tool for iterating to a good solution.. This is arguably the highest-leverage time investment in an ML project."
1657,1526895394440896517,1186043355710545920,Ive spent 1000s of hours building ML models over the last couple of years.. Here are some tips that would have made me work 10x faster (that you can read in 2 minutes):
1658,1526533004830470145,1186043355710545920,Powerful rule of thumb:. The best thing to learn next is what tripped you up on your last project.
1659,1526170620089708544,1186043355710545920,The best ensemble isn’t between multiple models. . It’s the ensemble of two brilliant data scientists.

1661,1525445832278802433,1186043355710545920,95% of the ML code you write is not code for fitting a model.. It’s for:. • Data collection. • Data cleaning. • Data exploration. • Feature engineering. • Model evaluation. • Model inference. • Model monitoring. Want to work more efficiently? Write more code and practice.
1662,1525083475048468482,1186043355710545920,Building out an ML project will teach you more about applied ML than any textbook.

1665,1524721083269533697,1186043355710545920,TL;DR:. 1. Raw data observation. 2. Model evaluation. 3. Smart baselines. 4. Strong starting points. 5. Rapid iteration. 6. Error analysis
1666,1524721080455159808,1186043355710545920,Error analysis. The only reliable way of improving your models is by thoroughly analyzing their predictions.. The average modeler stares at their error metric and hopes it gets better.. The best find specific errors and tailor solutions to them.
1667,1524721077615616000,1186043355710545920,"Rapid iteration. If we could know what techniques would work before attacking a problem, then we wouldnt need data scientists.. After pruning the bad ideas, the best modelers efficiently explore the remaining possibilities to land on the best solution.. Start small, work fast."
1668,1524721074780315648,1186043355710545920,"Starting strong. Think of the potential solutions to an ML problem as a nearly-infinite tree.. The most successful modelers can prune all but 0.1% of that tree before they even start.. If you know something wont work, why waste your valuable time?"
1669,1524721071986905089,1186043355710545920,"Useful baselines. Baselines are for measuring improvement, not just a vacuous number.. The best know to use realistic ones, such as human performance and intelligent heuristics.. The best model is the simplest, so always start there and see how much better you can get."
1670,1524721069193523200,1186043355710545920,"Ingenious model evaluation. The best modelers are the best model evaluators.. If there was a Venn Diagram of the two groups, it would be a circle.. This is a skill that anyone can learn, but it takes several hundred hours of modeling experience to become an expert."
1671,1524721066358153216,1186043355710545920,"Observation of raw data. EDA from aggregations is good.. EDA by looking at thousands of samples is the best.. EDA is for becoming one with your data, with all of its bumps and sharp edges. This is how to do it.. Measure this in hours, not minutes."
1672,1524721063594135552,1186043355710545920,6 habits of the top 0.1% of machine learning modelers:
1673,1524358698805522433,1186043355710545920,"The top 1% of data scientists are fantastic at:. • Evaluating their models. • Engaging stakeholders. • Building minimally-complex solutions . • Iterating rapidly. At any company. In any industry.. All of them have these qualities. . If you dont, heres what you need to perfect."
1674,1523996311917268994,1186043355710545920,My 6 step pipeline for training tabular models:. 1. EDA. 2. Simple baseline. 3. Create+test evaluation setup. 4. Simple model with simple features. 5. Error analysis. 6. Feature engineering. Repeat 5+6 until you run out of time!
1675,1523633906670465025,1186043355710545920,90% of building an ML model is good model evaluation.. 100% of getting anyone to use it is communicating its value.. Don’t just learn to evaluate your models — learn how to sell them.
1676,1523271510273576960,1186043355710545920,"2 steps to train great models:. 1. Train a bad one. 2. Improve it. Any data scientist can do step 1, and most can attempt step 2.. But &lt;0.1% are truly great at step 2."
1677,1522950767740538880,1186043355710545920,"Aspiring data scientists often ask:. “What’s the better way to solve this problem, X or Y?”. Sometimes there’s an obvious answer.. But 95% of the time, you just need to go try it and see what works best."
1678,1522909119547514881,1186043355710545920,"Tons of SaaS builders are using GPT-3. . And 98% of them use it poorly.. It’s an incredible tool, but skilled prompt engineering can get you quality results 10x more often."
1679,1522546744810041345,1186043355710545920,What data scientists think they need for a good solution:. • Bigger servers. • Bigger data. • Bigger models. What they SHOULD be using for a good solution:. • A smaller model. • A deep knowledge of the data. • A debugger. Rapid iteration + solid theory + solid coding = success

House of Cards was one of the biggest successes in the history of TV, and its because it hit its audience squarely in the forehead.. Largely, thanks to data science."
1774,1516386186981376000,1186043355710545920,"So, subscribers watching shows featuring Spacey saw advertisements for the show featuring him.. Those watching Thelma and Louise, for example, saw advertisements featuring the female characters.. Serious film lovers saw ones that showed off Finchs style."
1775,1516386184154390533,1186043355710545920,"Ideation is great, but execution is everything.. They could have confidence in the talent on the show, but they needed to make sure their audience was excited."
1776,1516386181398732811,1186043355710545920,"They noticed 3 key things:. 1. The British version of House of Cards was a hit.. 2. Films with Kevin Spacey were, too.. 3. Their subscribers loved director of The Social Network, David Fincher.. At the intersection of those 3 key insights was a huge potential audience."
1777,1516386178651414529,1186043355710545920,"Netflix hadnt slowed down on their data science since the early 2000s.. They now were a huge streaming company, with rich customer data and oodles of computing power.. As a result, they knew so much more about what their subscribers wanted than traditional media companies."
1778,1516386175916785666,1186043355710545920,"Any time a company reinvents itself, theyre taking a huge risk.. Creating original media can cost $100+ million.. One or two huge flops could prove fatal.. So, how did they do it?"

1872,1506239301700497416,1186043355710545920,Spend a ton of time on model evaluation and error analysis. Your models are practically useless if you cant get a reliable measure of their accuracy and you dont know how to improve them.. These 2 skills will improve your modeling skills astronomically.
1873,1506239298143617025,1186043355710545920,"Collect your own data. Nothing gives you an appreciation for EDA like collecting your own data.. I know it sucks, but for as many projects as possible, collect your own raw data.. Youll learn more about EDA by doing that than any course or guide could ever teach you."
1874,1506239295333433344,1186043355710545920,"Learn like a specialist. The field is expanding far too quickly to be a generalist.. If you try to be one, you will drown and take forever to build a skill that can actually drive value.. Instead, pick some topics that you love to specialize in.. Youll be marketable in no time."
1875,1506239292472930306,1186043355710545920,"The next thing you should learn is the last thing you struggled with. If you focus on building, youll never question what you should be learning next.. If your model sucked, find a better technique.. If your data was a mess, improve your ETL skills.. The cycle never stops."
1876,1506239289704660994,1186043355710545920,"Building projects &gt; all else. Every ML technique is a means to an end.. If it isnt going to be used to build something that someone can use, its useless.. So, if you arent learning how to build projects, youre not really learning anything useful."
1877,1506239286948995084,1186043355710545920,"Any online course is 2-3+ years behind the field. It takes long enough for the teacher to learn the material, put together a curriculum, validate it, and teach it that most courses you find are fairly out of date.. Another reason not to become reliant on bootcamps and courses."
1878,1506239284147212288,1186043355710545920,Bootcamps and courses are nothing more than introductions. Theres no way to effectively teach a course on a technique/subject that captures all of the nuances in applying that thing.. The only way to figure them out is by applying your knowledge by building something.
1879,1506239281412509696,1186043355710545920,9 guiding principles for learning data science:
1880,1505876887112880130,1186043355710545920,Wrong way to learn:. 1. Learn the basics for everything. 2. Learn the intermediates for everything. 3. Become an expert in everything. Right way to learn:. 1. Learn the basics. 2. Find what you love. 3. Become an expert in that. 4. Repeat steps 2 &amp; 3. Specialization is a superpower.
1881,1505514499855462402,1186043355710545920,Your 5-step guide to learning anything in data science:. 1. Learn enough to start. 2. Build. 3. Build more. 4. Build some more. 5. Teach what you learned to someone else. The best data scientists are builders with deep knowledge. This is how to become that.
1882,1505152110496690181,1186043355710545920,"Machine learning superpower:. Deep knowledge of powerful tools.. Experience with the best frameworks lets you:. • Set up SOTA methods in hours. • Focus more on value and less on boilerplate. • Quickly go from R&amp;D to production. Go crush your problems, quickly."
1883,1504789728062627846,1186043355710545920,"The explore/exploit principle for data science:. Explore as many new ideas as you can.. Then, exploit the best one as much as possible.. Dont get lost exploring, and dont get stuck exploiting."
1884,1504427379590017030,1186043355710545920,"Twitter threads only allow me to go into so much detail on complex, information-rich topics such as this.. I write about this kind of topic in my newsletter, so if you want more, subscribe!"
1885,1504427376792387585,1186043355710545920,TL;DR:. 1. Empathize with the task. 2. Anticipate future data. 3. Copious error analysis. 4. Dont overfit on your validation set. 5. Verify your validation strategy. Follow me  for more high-signal ML content.
1886,1504427373953163265,1186043355710545920,"5. Verify your validation strategy . Before deploying your model, simulate its performance in production to check the robustness of your evaluation setup.. Test sets dont fully accomplish this since you may not have accounted for data differences from step number 2!"
1887,1504427371297841160,1186043355710545920,This also goes for things like ReduceLROnPlateau in Keras/torch. Use a consistent scheduler instead!
1888,1504427368575758341,1186043355710545920,An easy way of doing that:. 1. Train your model on each fold. 2. See how many training steps you took on each fold. 3. Take the average number of training steps. 4. Train your final model(s) for that average number of steps
1889,1504427365828505607,1186043355710545920,"To avoid this problem, dont use methods like early stopping that are contingent on model performance on a single validation fold.. Instead, in the case of early stopping, tune your training runs so that, on average, your last iteration is your best iteration."
1890,1504427363072831493,1186043355710545920,"4. Dont overfit on your validation set. Keep in mind that any individual validation set is a minority of your total dataset.. If you use methods like early stopping, you risk optimizing a model on that minority of your dataset, rather than what works on the larger dataset."
1891,1504427360325541900,1186043355710545920,"3. Do copious error analysis. No matter how robust your evaluation setup is, a top-line error metric is only so helpful.. You should focus more on identifying the ways that your model is failing."
1892,1504427357532155904,1186043355710545920,Here are some examples of differences you might see in production data: . • Image resolution. • New products. • Changes in market conditions. • Changes in how users use your product
1893,1504427354742923265,1186043355710545920,"2. Anticipate future data. Its important to remember that the data youll see in production can differ from your training data.. This goes for the usual things like not letting a time series model see future data, but theres so much more."
1894,1504427351853043712,1186043355710545920,1. Empathize with the task. The best evaluation setups are grounded in a deep understanding of how the task is performed and how the model will work in production.. This involves a lot of pre-work (talking to stakeholders and subject-matter experts) to truly be done effectively.
1895,1504427348850053121,1186043355710545920,"Model evaluation is the worst taught skill in machine learning.. You can spend all the time you want learning about new models, data preprocessing, etc., but its all a waste of time if your evaluation sucks.. Here are 5 principles to follow to create a solid evaluation setup:"
1896,1504064959944167428,1186043355710545920,"How to spend time building most ML models:. Old way:. - Tons of literature review. - Bespoke statistical representation. - Intense assumption checking. New way:. - Off-the-shelf model. - Data curation, evaluation, EDA. - Stakeholder engagement. Spend your time wisely."

1900,1503702584367869954,1186043355710545920,"6. Production. The main concern youll have is data drift. Make sure you have a monitoring system that you check in with on a regular basis.. Personally, I love adversarial validation to identify data drift. Its one of the most powerful and underused techniques in ML."
1901,1503702581637353472,1186043355710545920,"LSTMs/GRUs/Transformers. If you have enough data and spend enough time tuning the model, you can beat LightGBM/XGBoost sometimes.. The same feature engineering techniques work, but keep in mind that these models are much more finicky about the scale of the data."
1902,1503702578860724227,1186043355710545920,"LightGBM/XGBoost. Youre probably not going to do better than this.. For these models, rolling/lag features on the target variable work fantastically.. Other great features include grouped aggregations -- this is how you help the model distinguish different groups in the data."

1904,1503702573387182080,1186043355710545920,4. Model evaluation. Any answer other than roll-forward/expanding window cross-validation is wrong for 99.999% of problems.. Do NOT do any sort of random split on your samples that doesn’t ensure future values aren’t included.. That’s a death sentence for a model.
1905,1503702570614677508,1186043355710545920,"3. Domain expertise. If available, ALWAYS engage with someone that understands how the data is collected and dynamics at play from the business side.. There can be huge spikes caused by collection issues, strikes, out of stocks, you name it.. These conversations are invaluable."
1906,1503702567863271429,1186043355710545920,"2. Benchmarking. Predicting the mean is decent, but keep in mind that even a naive forecaster could outperform that usually.. Try things that better consider the domain, such as a rolling mean, predicting the value seen in the last day of available data, etc."
1907,1503702565128597506,1186043355710545920,"1. EDA. The best way to start any ML problem.. Here are some things to look at in time series data:. • Seasonality (monthly, daily, etc.). • Trends (big for proper evaluation). • Autocorrelation. • Diff. between older and newer series. • Tons of raw samples"
1908,1503702562171629570,1186043355710545920,"Modern ML research loves to ignore time series forecasting.. Sure, language sequence modeling is huge, but forecasting isn’t..

2116,1485598588365258753,1186043355710545920,"5. Periodic check-ins. Eventually, you will reach a point where the model performs consistently enough that it doesn’t need constant monitoring.. At this stage (and for the rest of the model’s life), set up regular, but less frequent check ups to evaluate its performance."
2117,1485598585609539586,1186043355710545920,4. Monitor it closely. The worst thing you can do is throw a model into production and forget about it.. No amount of model validation can 100% prepare you for the real world.. Use human-in-the-loop tactics wherever you can.
2118,1485598582845571072,1186043355710545920,"3. Do the relevant research. You don’t need to reinvent the wheel..

2127,1484511132530339842,1186043355710545920,"3. Dont build without a specific goal. Before you build, sit down with your stakeholder. Figure out how accurate is accurate enough.. A good way to start: if the task is handled by a human, evaluate how accurate the human is.. If you can beat that, you build a convincing case."
2128,1484511131452383232,1186043355710545920,"2. Convert your loss function into 💰 . Money is the universal language. Everyone in a business understands what money means.. Dont tell them that your model is X% more accurate or faster, tell them how much money it saves/generates."
2129,1484511130328309765,1186043355710545920,1. Sell it to the decision makers. Youre probably not trying convincing your direct stakeholder.. Youre probably trying convincing their boss.. Your pitch should be one that best helps your direct stakeholder sell it to them.

2145,1483061564064165888,1186043355710545920,The history of machine learning is one big story. Concepts will stick when you think of them like a chapter in that story.. The steps of that story should be:. 1. Where was the field?. 2. What was the problem?. 3. Why is it unique?
2146,1483061563007266816,1186043355710545920,3 steps to learn any complex machine learning concept:
2147,1482699169819029504,1186043355710545920,"The worst taught skill in machine learning: model validation.. For whatever reason, most universities find it sufficient to discuss train/test splitting and simple cross validation... and thats it.. Model validation is an art.. The best data scientists do it like Picasso."
2148,1482336784830795776,1186043355710545920,The four questions you must ask yourself before you build a model:. 1. What are the inputs/outputs in training?. 2. What are the inputs/outputs in production?. 3. What are you expecting it to learn?. 4. What happens when it fails?
2149,1481974423364124675,1186043355710545920,"Thanks for reading and Im glad we all know the truth about batch norm.. If you liked this, Ive been posting threads on machine learning nearly every day. . Follow me and learn more about the interesting parts of the field and how to be an elite practitioner!"
2150,1481974422332272640,1186043355710545920,"So, after all of that, here is what we actually know:. 1. Batch norm provides regularization. 2. This regularization lets you use higher learning rates. 3. Until recently, deep models needed it.. Thats pretty much it."
2151,1481974421245992961,1186043355710545920,"Some theories have been proposed about the true reason for its success.. For instance Santurkar et. al. claimed it smooths the loss landscape.. Unfortunately, theories are just about all we have."
2152,1481974420247699460,1186043355710545920,"By showing this, they (seemingly) refuted the central claims of the original paper."
2153,1481974419178151936,1186043355710545920,Those plots show two things about the difference between regular batch norm and the noised version with covariate shift:. 1. Theres almost no difference in performance. 2. The distributions of activations are quite similar
2154,1481974417676648449,1186043355710545920,"They set up an experiment where noise was added to the activations coming out of each layer, immediately after batch norm was applied.. The noise had non-zero mean and non-unit variance, and it changed at every time step. . This purposefully causes covariate shift.. The results:"
2155,1481974412597338113,1186043355710545920,"This paper showed two main things:. 1. It doesnt reduce covariate shift.. 2. Even if it did, that wouldnt help.. Heres how they justified it:"
2156,1481974411523604480,1186043355710545920,"A few papers were released that dove into this.. One of these was titled, simply: . How Does Batch Normalization Help Optimization? by Santurkar et. al. . (h/t )"
2157,1481974410445656068,1186043355710545920,"Regardless, it was obvious this method helped a lot and the authors had discovered something monumental.. Over the next few years, several researchers worked to discover the truth that seemed missing."
2158,1481974409376063492,1186043355710545920,"In addition, their central claim had a big implication: that the reduction of covariate shift helps the model.. Reading the paper leaves the reader feeling that the claim, while interestingly intuitive, wasnt definitively proven."
2159,1481974407924908032,1186043355710545920,"However, there was a bit of a problem.. A close reading of the paper showed that if batch norm had an effect, it wasnt a huge one.. Take a look at this graphic from the paper that tries to justify reduced covariate shift. . Its not really that conclusive!"
2160,1481974403051130883,1186043355710545920,"The results were staggering.. Their best model had a top-5 error rate nearly 20% lower than the next highest score.. The authors, Ioffe and Szegedy, had struck gold."
2161,1481974401817972738,1186043355710545920,"In other words, a layer in a model may start by only seeing activations between, say, -1 and 1.. However, as training progressed, the activations flowing into that layer may increase their size and scale.. By trainings end, the incoming activations may be between, say, 0 and 10."
2162,1481974400731602944,1186043355710545920,"In 2015, a paper came out with a bold claim.. Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift. The claim was that the major issue hampering deep networks was that the scales of the activations flowing through the model fluctuated."
2163,1481974399586553857,1186043355710545920,"However, this brought about crippling issues.. Most notably, the deeper the model was, the more noisy the loss curves.. Because the models loss was more volatile, lower learning rates had to be used. . This made deep models expensive for the era and time-consuming to train."
2164,1481974398026682369,1186043355710545920,(sidenote: . I wrote a thread on how ResNet came about during that time. . Read it if youre interested in the history behind the developement of modern computer vision architectures).
2165,1481974396726087681,1186043355710545920,"Around this time, computer vision was entering a renaissance.. Imagenet records were being broken left and right, and the theme was consistent:. Deeper models were the way to go."
2166,1481974395232927745,1186043355710545920,"You may think deep learning models are finicky and difficult to train now, but just prior to 2015, it was far worse.. Take a look at how bumpy the loss is of a VGG model with and without batch norm (h/t Santurkar et. al.) :"
2167,1481974389021110273,1186043355710545920,"You probably dont know why batch normalization works.. Its one of the most influential deep learning components, and yet the vast majority of practitioners think it works for the wrong reasons.. The reality is, were not certain why it works.. Heres what we know 🧵"
2168,1481612034177331200,1186043355710545920,"To sum it up:. Learn the concept and build up an intuition for why it works. . You should be able to explain without using any math for most methods.. The math is important, but only as far as it achieves the conceptual goal."
2169,1481612032944205826,1186043355710545920,"I have forgotten the math behind the Adam optimizer many times.. But I have never forgotten the reason it works.. Yes, the math is certainly important if you ever want to implement it, but this can be referenced at the moment that you need it."
2170,1481612031916589056,1186043355710545920,What makes a method stick in my head is hearing the concept that makes it work.. Momentum in SGD helps to push through bumpy loss regions.. Batch norm smooths the loss landscape by helping scale and shift activations.
2171,1481612030695985155,1186043355710545920,"So why are we taught with such an emphasis on the math?. More often than not, mathematical justification for a method is created after the fact b/c researchers want to be rigorous.. When math is involved, it’s the means that achieves the intuitive end, not the other way around."
2172,1481612029605531652,1186043355710545920,"One of the biggest misconceptions about deep learning research is that new research arises from mathematical derivation.. Breakthroughs in DL come from intuitive realizations about the issues a method has, not because a researcher sat down and furiously scribbled proofs."
2173,1481612028435640321,1186043355710545920,"You were probably taught deep learning in an overly complex, difficult to comprehend manner.. After spending years learning in this field, I believe Ive discovered the best ways to understand it.. Heres how I think everyone should be taught 🧵"
2174,1481310015008874498,1186043355710545920,Whats a machine learning/deep learning concept or method that you can never quite get to stick in your head?. The one you always seem to forget the details behind?

2176,1481249629190582272,1186043355710545920,"So why do I think that excerpt from the JAX docs is important?. To me, it shows their dedication to doing one thing well.. Sure, integration with a JAX-built dataloader could be really nice.. But this is what open-source ecosystems are for."
2177,1481249627982626819,1186043355710545920,"I still believe that PyTorch is great at this.. However, as the devs feel the need to appeal to more audiences, they are quickly losing their touch."
2178,1481249626879496192,1186043355710545920,It was a library that gave you much more control of the individual steps. . As opposed to how TensorFlow had you floating on a rigid cloud and handled everything mysteriously behind the curtains.. This was so popular that even TensorFlow transitioned to that style.
2179,1481249625751232512,1186043355710545920,Software design principles tell us that libraries should do one thing really well.. Andrejs point is that PyTorch used to do that; PyTorch made its name as a much more hackable version of TensorFlow.

3294,1542838487304617984,19067150,will do a special type of traceback when an exception is thrown during the handling of another exception.. This is what that looks like:
3295,1542838482732720130,19067150,"You might want to catch an exception in  and log it and do some cleanup.. But you dont want the program to continue. In those situations, you could call sys.exit() or you could re-raise the exception.. In this example, you do the latter:"

3302,1542838450671452162,19067150,"Pro Tip: Do NOT do this! ⚠️. When you catch all the exceptions, you can hide bugs that you want to actually catch!. This leads to difficult and frustrating debugging.. You should ALWAYS use specific exception types whenever possible!"
